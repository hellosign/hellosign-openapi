"OpenApi::TITLE": HelloSign API
"OpenApi::DESCRIPTION": HelloSign v3 API
"OpenApi::AUTH::API_KEY": |-
  The most common method to authenticate against the HelloSign API is by using API keys. See the [API Settings page](https://app.hellosign.com/home/myAccount#api) for more information.

  Authentication is done via HTTP Basic Auth. Your API key is your basic auth username, and the password is blank.

  Example:

  ```shell
  APIKEY=YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE
  curl "https://api.hellosign.com/v3/template/list" \
      -u "${APIKEY}:"
  ```

  or, you can also pass the API key as part of the URL:

  ```shell
  APIKEY=YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE
  curl "https://${APIKEY}:@api.hellosign.com/v3/template/list"
  ```
"OpenApi::AUTH::OAUTH": |-
  You may also use an oauth2 token to perform API actions of behalf of
  other users after they grant you the authorization to do so. See our
  [Getting Started with OAuth 2.0](https://app.hellosign.com/api/oauthWalkthrough)
  for more information.

  Authentication is done via the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

  Example:

  ```shell
  OAUTHTOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_OAUTH_TOKEN_HERE
  curl 'https://api.hellosign.com/v3/signature_request/list' \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OAUTHTOKEN}"

"SignatureRequestCancel::SUMMARY": Cancel Incomplete Signature Request
"SignatureRequestCancel::DESCRIPTION": |-
  Cancels an incomplete signature request. This action is **not reversible**.

  The request will be canceled and signers will no longer be able to sign. If they try to access the signature request they will receive a HTTP 410 status code indicating that the resource has been deleted. Cancelation is asynchronous and a successful call to this endpoint will return an empty 200 OK response if the signature request is eligible to be canceled and has been successfully queued.

  This 200 OK response does not indicate a successful cancelation of the signature request itself. The cancelation is confirmed via the `signature_request_canceled` event. It is recommended that a  [callback handler](/api/reference/tag/Callbacks-and-Events) be implemented to listen for the `signature_request_canceled` event. This callback will be sent only when the cancelation has completed successfully. If a callback handler has been configured and the event has not been received within 60 minutes of making the call, check the status of the request in the [API Dashboard](https://app.hellosign.com/apidashboard) and retry the cancelation if necessary.

  To be eligible for cancelation, a signature request must have been sent successfully, must not yet have been signed by all signers, and you must either be the sender or own the API app under which it was sent. A partially signed signature request can be canceled.

  **NOTE**: To remove your access to a completed signature request, use the endpoint: `POST /signature_request/remove/[:signature_request_id]`.
"SignatureRequestCancel::SIGNATURE_REQUEST_ID": The id of the incomplete SignatureRequest to cancel.

"SignatureRequestCreateEmbedded::ALLOW_DECLINE": Allows signers to decline to sign a document if `true`. Defaults to `false`.
"SignatureRequestCreateEmbedded::ALLOW_REASSIGN": |-

  **Note**: Only available for Premium plan.
"SignatureRequestCreateEmbedded::CC_EMAIL_ADDRESSES": The email addresses that should be CCed.

A `template_created` event will be sent when the files are updated or a `template_error` event will be sent if there was a problem while updating the files. If a callback handler has been configured and the event has not been received within 60 minutes of making the call, check the status of the request in the API dashboard and retry the request if necessary.

  When used together with merge fields, `custom_fields` allows users to add pre-filled data to their signature requests.
  
  Pre-filled data can be used with "send-once" signature requests by adding merge fields with `form_fields_per_document` or [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) while passing values back with `custom_fields` together in one API call.
  
  For using pre-filled on repeatable signature requests, merge fields are added to templates in the HelloSign UI or by calling [/template/create_embedded_draft](/api/reference/operation/templateCreateEmbeddedDraft) and then passing `custom_fields` on subsequent signature requests referencing that template.
"Sub::CustomField::EDITOR": |-
