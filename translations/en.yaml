"SignatureRequestCancel::SUMMARY": Cancel Incomplete Signature Request
"SignatureRequestCancel::DESCRIPTION": |-
  Cancels an incomplete signature request. This action is **not reversible**.

  The request will be canceled and signers will no longer be able to sign. If they try to access the signature request they will receive a HTTP 410 status code indicating that the resource has been deleted. Cancelation is asynchronous and a successful call to this endpoint will return an empty 200 OK response if the signature request is eligible to be canceled and has been successfully queued.

  This 200 OK response does not indicate a successful cancelation of the signature request itself. The cancelation is confirmed via the `signature_request_canceled` event. It is recommended that a  [callback handler](/api/reference/tag/Callbacks-and-Events) be implemented to listen for the `signature_request_canceled` event. This callback will be sent only when the cancelation has completed successfully. If a callback handler has been configured and the event has not been received within 60 minutes of making the call, check the status of the request in the [API Dashboard](https://app.hellosign.com/apidashboard) and retry the cancelation if necessary.

  To be eligible for cancelation, a signature request must have been sent successfully, must not yet have been signed by all signers, and you must either be the sender or own the API app under which it was sent. A partially signed signature request can be canceled.

  **NOTE**: To remove your access to a completed signature request, use the endpoint: `POST /signature_request/remove/[:signature_request_id]`.
"SignatureRequestCancel::SIGNATURE_REQUEST_ID": The id of the incomplete SignatureRequest to cancel.

"SignatureRequestCreateEmbedded::SUBJECT": The subject in the email that will be sent to the signers.

If a callback handler has been configured and the event has not been received within 60 minutes of making the call, check the status of the request in the API dashboard and retry the request if necessary.

"Sub::BulkCustomField::NAME": The name of the custom field. Must be the field's `name` or `api_id`.
"Sub::BulkCustomField::VALUE": The value of the custom field.

"Sub::BulkSigner::DESCRIPTION": |-
  Add Signers to your Templated-based Signature Request. Allows the requester to specify editor options when a preparing a document.

  Currently only templates with a single role are supported. All signers must have the same `role` value.

"Sub::CC::DESCRIPTION": Add CC email recipients. Required when a CC role exists for the Template.
"Sub::CC::EMAIL_ADDRESS": The email address of the CC recipient.
"Sub::CC::ROLE": Must match an existing CC role in chosen Template(s). Multiple CC recipients cannot share the same CC role.

"Sub::CustomField::DESCRIPTION": |-
  When used together with merge fields, `custom_fields` allows users to add pre-filled data to their signature requests.
  
  Pre-filled data can be used with "send-once" signature requests by adding merge fields with `form_fields_per_document` or [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) while passing values back with `custom_fields` together in one API call.
  
  For using pre-filled on repeatable signature requests, merge fields are added to templates in the Dropbox Sign UI or by calling [/template/create_embedded_draft](/api/reference/operation/templateCreateEmbeddedDraft) and then passing `custom_fields` on subsequent signature requests referencing that template.
"Sub::CustomField::EDITOR": |-
  Used to create editable merge fields. When the value matches a role passed in with `signers`, that role can edit the data that was pre-filled to that field. This field is optional, but required when this custom field object is set to `required = true`.

  **Note**: Editable merge fields are only supported for single signer requests (or the first signer in ordered signature requests). If used when there are multiple signers in an unordered signature request, the editor value is ignored and the field won't be editable.
"Sub::CustomField::NAME": The name of a custom field. When working with pre-filled data, the custom field's name must have a matching merge field name or the field will remain empty on the document during signing.
"Sub::CustomField::REQUIRED": Used to set an editable merge field when working with pre-filled data. When `true`, the custom field must specify a signer role in `editor`.
"Sub::CustomField::TEMPLATE": An array defining values and options for custom fields. Required when a custom field exists in the Template.
"Sub::CustomField::VALUE": The string that resolves (aka "pre-fills") to the merge field on the final document(s) used for signing.
