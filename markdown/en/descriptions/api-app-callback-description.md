This type of callback URL is set up at the API app level. API apps are used to identify a partner integration and configure embedded flows ([embedded signign](https://app.hellosign.com/api/embeddedSigningWalkthrough), [embedded requesting](https://app.hellosign.com/api/embeddedRequestingWalkthrough), and [embedded templates](https://app.hellosign.com/api/embeddedTemplatesWalkthrough)) and [OAuth providers](https://app.hellosign.com/api/oauthWalkthrough)
        
All events that involve signature requests created by an API app are reported to this URL. The event will include a `client_id` field to indicate which app the event is being reported for, which allows multiple API apps to share the same callback URL.

You can manage your apps and their callbacks from the [settings page](https://app.hellosign.com/home/myAccount#api).
