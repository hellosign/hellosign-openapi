## Migrating from legacy SDK

This SDK is generated from our officially maintained [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/hellosign/hellosign-openapi/blob/development/openapi.yaml).
We've made important updates that introduce new functionality and create feature parity between the Dropbox Sign API and the SDK.
However, some of these changes are considered "breaking" in the sense that they'll require you to update your existing code in order to continue using the SDK.
Please refer to this [migration guide](https://developers.hellosign.com/docs/sdks/python/migration-guide/) for more information.

## Contributing

This repo is no longer accepting new issues or Pull Requests. All issues or
Pull Requests *must* be opened against the
[hellosign/hellosign-openapi](https://github.com/hellosign/hellosign-openapi) repo!

### Changes to the SDK code

You must make SDK code changes in the mustache file within the `templates`
directory that corresponds to the file you want updated.

We use [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to automatically
generate this SDK from the OAS, using the template files.

### Building

You must have `docker` (or `podman` linked to `docker`) installed. Highly
recommended to use
[rootless docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/).

Run the following and everything is done for you:

```shell
./run-build
```

*Attention*: Any changes you have made to the SDK code that you have not made
to the OAS file and/or the mustache template files _will be lost_ when you run
this command.
