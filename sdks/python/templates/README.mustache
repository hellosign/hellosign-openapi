## ⚠ This package is not yet ready for production use ⚠

We are working hard on getting this package ready, but it is not there, yet!

You should think twice before using package on anything critical.

The interfaces may change without warning. Backwards compatibility is not yet
guaranteed nor implied!

## Contributing

This repo is no longer accepting new issues or Pull Requests. All issues or
Pull Requests *must* be opened against the
[hellosign/hellosign-openapi](https://github.com/hellosign/hellosign-openapi) repo!

### Changes to the SDK code

You must make SDK code changes in the mustache file within the `templates`
directory that corresponds to the file you want updated.

We use [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to automatically
generate this SDK from the OAS, using the template files.

### Building

You must have `docker` (or `podman` linked to `docker`) installed. Highly
recommended to use
[rootless docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/).

Run the following and everything is done for you:

```shell
./run-build
```

*Attention*: Any changes you have made to the SDK code that you have not made
to the OAS file and/or the mustache template files _will be lost_ when you run
this command.
